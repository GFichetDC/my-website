## About Me

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Valencia, Spain, focusing on the study of active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets as potential sources of neutrinos. My research involves developing new numerical tools for simulating and modeling these jets. I have authored four first-author publications and have expertise in high-energy astrophysical phenomena, particularly relativistic jets in AGNs.

### Research Focus

My research centers on high-energy phenomena in the Universe, with a particular focus on the theoretical aspects of relativistic jets in AGNs. I develop simulation and modeling tools for these jets and have built expertise in data reduction and analysis as part of the H.E.S.S. consortium.

### Teaching and Outreach

I have taught courses at the master's level, supervised student projects, and participated in science outreach activities, including public lectures and classroom sponsorships.
