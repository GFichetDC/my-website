      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>RIPTIDE (Radiation and Integration Processes in Time-Dependent Environments) is a radiative transfer code developed to compute synchrotron emission from relativistic jets. It has been utilized in studies such as "Flare echos from relaxation shocks in perturbed relativistic jets" to analyze multi-wavelength flux variability. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Computes synchrotron emission and radiative transfer for given observation angles and frequencies.
          <li>Handles time-dependent scenarios in astrophysical environments.
          <li>Integrates with hydrodynamic simulations to analyze jet dynamics and emissions.
      </ul>

      <h2>Applications</h2>
      <p>RIPTIDE has been applied in research to demonstrate the appearance of trailing components behind leading moving shocks in relativistic jets, providing insights into jet dynamics and emission characteristics. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

      <h2>Publications</h2>
      <p>For a detailed study utilizing RIPTIDE, refer to the publication: "Flare echos from relaxation shocks in perturbed relativistic jets." :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
