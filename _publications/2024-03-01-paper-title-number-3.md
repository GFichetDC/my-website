This study focuses on the galactic winds of starburst galaxies and their impact on large-scale structures. The objective is to analyze the influence of magnetic fields on the evolution of these structures. The simulations suggest that magnetic fields affect the shape and evolution of wind bubbles but cannot alone explain the observed structures in certain galaxies like M82. The results highlight the potential role of other factors, such as the galactic disk, and identify promising areas for efficient particle acceleration.

â†’ The study of galactic winds in starburst galaxies is relevant to your integral model on relativistic jets, as it provides insights into the complex interactions between magnetic fields and matter in extreme environments. Understanding these dynamics in different astrophysical contexts enriches and refines the integral model, integrating similar but distinct phenomena, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of large-scale astrophysical processes.
