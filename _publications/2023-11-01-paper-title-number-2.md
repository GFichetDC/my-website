Recent observations highlight the essential role of AGNs in producing high-energy neutrinos. This study focuses on the object 5BZB J0630-2406, recently associated with neutrino emission during the first 7 years of observations by IceCube. The primary objective is to model the spectral energy distribution of this object, exploring various scenarios from purely leptonic models to lepto-hadronic models, including external photon fields. The interactions between protons and external radiation fields are explored, suggesting the production of a detectable neutrino flux by IceCube. The results indicate that hadronic processes involving very energetic protons leave an imprint on the X-ray spectral emission shape, supporting the hypothesis of neutrino production.

→ This study explores new aspects of the future integral model, particularly the impact of protons in jets, which is vital for understanding multi-messenger emissions.
