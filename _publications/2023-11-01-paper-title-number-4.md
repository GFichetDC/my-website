The physical phenomena explaining the classification of Active Galactic Nuclei (NAG) are still not well understood. Furthermore, new observational markers, such as the offset between the radio and optical emission centers, seem to indicate the presence of intrinsic physical phenomena within the jets. In this study, we propose the interaction between the jet and a stellar population. These interactions lead to mass entrainment in the jet due to proton enrichment. This mass entrainment results in more or less pronounced jet deceleration depending on the stellar density, and consequently, energy dissipation. In this study, we used the RIPTIDE code to produce radio and optical emission maps and highlight the presence of this radio-optical offset by quantitatively reproducing VLBI and Gaia optical observations for different types of NAG. This study underscores the crucial impact of stars on jet characteristics and our understanding of the current classification of NAG. Moreover, it paves the way for the multi-messenger study of these jet-star interactions.
