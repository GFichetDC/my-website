This study presents the AM³ code, used to simulate multi-messenger emissions, including neutrinos, from various astrophysical phenomena such as active galactic nuclei or gamma-ray bursts. AM³ efficiently solves the equations for the spectral and temporal evolution of particle densities, including photons, electrons, protons, etc., considering a range of non-thermal processes. It allows tracking the particle cascade and offers adjustable precision. This code has applications in various astrophysical environments.

→ This publication introduces an innovative tool developed in the context of proton studies, the AM³ code. Publishing this code facilitates access to astrophysical modeling, enabling its use in modeling various objects. This approach not only promotes collaboration and innovation within the scientific community but also paves the way for the publication of RIPTIDE.
