This study focuses on the variability of relativistic astrophysical jets in AGNs, based on the acceleration of relativistic particles by internal shocks. The primary objective is to characterize the evolution of emission regions in the jet and study their multi-wavelength signatures during interactions between mobile shock waves and stationary shocks. Relativistic jet simulations are performed using the MPI-AMRVAC code, including the injection of non-thermal electrons and the production of radiation maps up to X-rays with RIPTIDE. The results show that bright flares occur during intense shock interactions, with trailing components behind the mobile shock wave, explaining observations such as those of the radio galaxy 3C 111.

â†’ This study marks a significant advancement in the integral model, incorporating crucial elements such as the injection of relativistic electrons in MPI-AMRVAC simulations and the extension of radiative treatments in RIPTIDE.
