This study explores the complex interactions between mobile shock waves and stationary shocks in relativistic astrophysical jets, which play a key role in the observed variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The primary objective is to simulate these interactions and characterize the resulting radio flares using relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The MPI-AMRVAC code and the RIPTIDE radiative transfer code are employed to explore the impact of magnetic configuration and jet stratification. The results reveal that the presence of a large-scale magnetic structure alters the jet morphology, leading to bright radio flares with distinct characteristics during shock interactions. A promising application is demonstrated on the source 3C 273, highlighting the insightfulness of the shock-shock model.

â†’ This study is essential for establishing the foundations of the integral model, highlighting the dynamic processes of relativistic jets in AGNs. It also demonstrates the value of connecting simulations performed with MPI-AMRVAC and post-processing done via RIPTIDE, emphasizing the synergy between these tools in enhancing our understanding of relativistic jets.
